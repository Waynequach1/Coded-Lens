        body: "Even though black minorities consistently fall far below acceptable accuracy rates, these algorithms continue to be applied to use everywhere. With minor implications like being unable to capture your face on your phone for screen unlocks to being unable to enter your home because your apartment has implemented a facial recognition security system. These issues however are just the cherry on top, there are even real threat of life consequences like misidentifying of criminals resulting in wrongful convictions. The continued misuse and lack of clarity on the appropriateness of these algorithms and their impact in policing and security could pave the way for rogue ai due to the lack of laws and rules in place for the deployment of undeveloped ai.",

        body: "These algorithms unfairly and sometimes illegally remove the fairness and equity when it comes to hiring employees. One of the largest implications of these algorithms is that they are \"black boxes\" meaning they don't need to explain how they got to the decision they did. Thus, when users are declined a job they'll have no idea why or even if it was for a legal reason. Amazon\'s discrimination against black women is one issue that highlights illegal discrimination by these algorithms. Additionally, there have been cases where individuals with disabilities have been declined due to their disabilities.",

        technology: "Crime Watch Algorithms ",
        body: "The idea of stopping crime in its place seems ideal but when put into actual play it has serious complications. For starters, it induces officers to continually patrol areas of concerns and thus, raising the crime watch in an area. However, this also increase the number of incarcerations since more policing will increase the probability of catching suspects. However, this ends up reinforcing the algorithms and leads to officers continually to patrol specific areas to now generate arrests not just catch it. Further, these algorithms are sometimes linked to probable cause for searching innocent citizens and arresting them after doing a \"legal search\" since the algorithm is considered probable cause even though it is severely biased.",
