<p class="center">Using the lens we can uncover biases in the following technologies</p>

        One of the most commonly overlooked biases in technology is soap dispensers. They exist everywhere and yet 
        for a minority of people automatic soap dispensers don't work. This is because automatic soap dispensers rely 
        on infared energy which gets absorbed more in darker people thus the machine is not able to pick up any infrared
        energy to dispense the soap.

        Facial Recognition

    <p class="text-left-indent">
       Another super popular bias in technology is facial recognition. Many countries have already started enforcing
       use of this technology in widespread areas from simple beauty apps to use in security or even the surveillance of individuals.
       The major concern however is that facial recognition is inherently biased. These technologies use ai an feed it data on which it 
       used to learn from the data however is mainly dominated by a white male sample size. As such people of color and women often get 
       higher inaccuracies when using these technology. Further, the cross section of these minorties suffer most from this biased dataset
        with substantially higher inaccuracies then white males.
