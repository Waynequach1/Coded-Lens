# Coded-Lens

A 4th year project at UofT for CSC398.

This repo hosts a website for informing inviduals of the
issues related with coded bias in existing and upcoming technology.

Currently contains: 
- A few simple pages for informing users
- A navbar for user ease of navigation
- 3 activities
    - A Quiz based on content read
    - An interactable chat bot
    - A look into classroom interactions by students
 - A credits page for users to learn more from and give credits

Things that can still be done:
- Clean up CSS to some degree
- Include information on Alexa prompts on the key points of each conversation
- Perhaps more detailed info can be added
- More....
